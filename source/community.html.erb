  <li>Public or private harassment</li>
  <li>Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission</li>
  <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
</ul>

<h3>Our Responsibilities</h3>

<p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>

<p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
